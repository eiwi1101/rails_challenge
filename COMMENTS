# Rails Challenge

To run the rails challenge, you're going to need Redis and Resque
installed on your system. Thankfully, these are generally available
through your package manager.

On Debian/Apt based systems, run:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install redis-server resque
```

## Launching the App

The app has a Procfile to launch everything in one step. If
you have installed foreman (`ruby-foreman` on apt), you can
run `foreman start` and everything should magically work.

Otherwise, you'll want to start Rails, and Resque:

```bash
$ bundle exec rails server
$ QUEUE=* bundle exec rake resque:work
```

If Resque is offline, the background jobs won't be run, and that's
a sad thing. If you want to check on Resque and see how it's doing,
the web view is mounted at: 
[http://localhost:3000/jobs](http://localhost:3000/jobs).


Cheers! :shipit:
